## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will automatically scan for arbitrage opportunities. You can customize the trading parameters in the configuration file to suit your strategy. 

### Configuration Options

- **Slippage**: Adjust the slippage tolerance for trades.
- **Trade Amount**: Set the minimum and maximum trade amounts.
- **Profit Threshold**: Define the minimum profit percentage for executing trades.

## How It Works

The Arbitrage Bot operates by continuously monitoring the prices of tokens on PancakeSwap and BakerySwap. When it detects a significant price difference, it executes a series of transactions:

1. **Flash Loan Acquisition**: The bot takes a flash loan to acquire the necessary tokens.
2. **Token Swap**: It swaps the tokens on the cheaper exchange.
3. **Repayment**: The bot repays the flash loan with a small fee.
4. **Profit Realization**: Any remaining tokens are kept as profit.

### Example Scenario

1. **Price on PancakeSwap**: Token A = $100
2. **Price on BakerySwap**: Token A = $105
3. **Arbitrage Opportunity Detected**: The bot executes the following:
   - Takes a flash loan for Token A from a lending platform.
   - Swaps Token A on PancakeSwap for Token B.
   - Sells Token B on BakerySwap for a higher price.
   - Repays the flash loan and keeps the profit.
